# Digital project NLP
### Description
Text mining and NLP analysis on ‘The Quantified Self’ speeches transcripts.
The project goal is to exlore the discourse of the presentations that people have given about their own self-research projects. 

'The Quantified Self is an international community of users and makers of self-tracking tools who share an interest in “self-knowledge through numbers.” If you are tracking for any reason - to answer a health question, achieve a goal, explore an idea, or simply because you are curious - you can find help and support here.'
